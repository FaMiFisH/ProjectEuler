What is the 10 001st prime number?

The solutions uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given number n. Then it finds the 10001st using a quick loop. I came across this algorthim whilst researching different ways to caluculate prime numbers. The solution is best implemented in Haskell as it takes advantage of Haskell's lazy evaluation to generate infinite prime numbers.
